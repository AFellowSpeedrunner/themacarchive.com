## Welcome to [The Mac Archive](https://afellowspeedrunner.github.io/themacarchive.com)!

You can download different versions of [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) here!

All files are virus checked and hosted on [DepositFiles](https://dfiles.eu/) by me!

Due to DepositFiles having a STUPID STUPID limitation I will be now moving files to archive.org either known as The Internet Archive! I also learned that DepositFiles delete files after 1 year so I will be moving them over. I will bring the site download links offline. Meanwhile, you can look at the Archived OS X pages in links that to The Wayback Machine.


### The backstory

I decided to make the archive because I was looking for some versions of [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and I couldn't find the version for 2 HOURS. I finally did find one and thought "Huh, why don't make an archive for this kinda stuff. I have a lot of versions so it would be nice to help people!" and so here I am! I hope you like the archive! Enjoy using [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)!
