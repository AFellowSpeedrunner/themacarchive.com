## Welcome to [The Mac Archive](https://afellowspeedrunner.github.io/themacarchive.com)!

You can download different versions of [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) here!

All files are virus checked and hosted on [DepositFiles](https://dfiles.eu/) by me!

### The backstory

I decided to make the archive because I was looking for some versions of [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and I couldn't find the version for 2 HOURS. I finally did find one and thought "Huh, why don't make an archive for this kinda stuff. I have a lot of versions so it would be nice to help people!" and so here I am! I hope you like the archive! Enjoy using [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)!

### Versions I've uploaded so far

I haven't got any yet and mainly because I'm working on the site but I am uploading [10.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_10.0) right now!
